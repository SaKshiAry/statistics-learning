# statistics-learning
After a long time I have completed my statistics and solved some of the problems 
I tried to use all the ztest, t-test, chi-square test and annova test with best of my knowledge.

Some of my learning are as such:

Z-test : The z-test is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of two groups, or whether a sample mean differs significantly from a known population mean. 
Assumptions of Z-test :- 
1. The samples are independent.
2. The data follows a normal distribution.
3. The sample size is large (n > 30), or the population standard deviations are known.

T_test :A t-test is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. There are three main types of t-tests:
One-sample t-test: Tests whether the mean of a single group is significantly different from a known mean.
Independent two-sample t-test: Tests whether the means of two independent groups are significantly different.
Paired t-test: Tests whether the means of two related groups are significantly different.

Chi-square : The chi-square test is a statistical test used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables.

ANOVA test : ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical test used to compare the means of three or more groups to see if at least one group mean is different from the others.
